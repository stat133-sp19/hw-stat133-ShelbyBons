<br>

**Ingredients**

-   6 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   4 teaspoons ground ginger
-   4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
-   1 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves
-   1 teaspoon finely ground pepper
-   1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
-   1 cup (2 sticks or 1/2 pound) unsalted butter (at room temperature)
-   1 cup packed dark-brown sugar
-   2 large eggs
-   1 cup unsulfured molasses

**Special Kitchen Tools**

-   Cookie Cutter

<br>

#### Instructions

Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, spices and salt in a large bowl and set aside. Beat butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in eggs and molasses. Add flour mixture, mixing on low until just combined. Divide dough into thirds and wrap each in plastic. Refrigerate until cold and firm, about one hour or up to two days.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 1/4-inch thick. Cut into shapes of your choice, such as snowflakes or gingerbread men. Spread two inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and refrigerate until the cookies firm up again, about 15 minutes.

Bake cookies until *crisp but not dark*, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on sheets on wire racks.

*Extra Tip*: When cool, you can decorate the cookies with icing and sprinkles. These make for perfect Christmas cookies!

### 3. Euclidean Distance

<br>

#### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\textbf{pq}})$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if *p* = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and *q* = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\\textbf{p,q}) = d(\\textbf{q,p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_{1}-p\_{1})^{2}+(q\_{2}-p\_{2})^{2}+ ...+(q\_{n}-p\_{n})^{2}}$$
$$= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{\\substack{i=1}}(q\_{i}-p\_{i})^{2}}.$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vecotr. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vecotr measures the length of the vecotr:

$$\\|p\\|=\\sqrt{p\_{1}^{2}+p\_{2}^{2}+...+p\_{n}^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\textbf{p.p}},$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
